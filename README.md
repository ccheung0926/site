# Wall, the front cover of the internet

Wall relies on a chrome-extension. Having this 'extension' allows one to turn Google's homepage into what it has always been, the most prominent neighborhood-wallfront in the global village. What good is a wall without graffiti?

Wall's civic rehabilitation of Google's homepage is ensured by two modes of user-experience:

(1) in which a visitor to the page is greeted with an elaboration of it - we'll call it 'a canvas' - passed on to them by someone else in the Wall network. Here, they have three choices: (i) pass it further onward to four more users nearby in the network, (ii) not pass it on, (iii) add to it and pass it on (to four users). Of course, they can always initiate their own canvas, and send it off, fingers crossed.

(2) in which a visitor to the page is greeted by the canvas that has been the most passed-along within some (user specified) geographical boundary.

The user will only be prompted to contribute to the network, through the first mode, every five or so visits to Google's homepage. Otherwise, they can sit back and enjoy the fruits of this liquid democracy, through the second mode, whenever they happen to visit the most visited page on the internet.

Wall will also have an accompanying website that will carry many supplementary features, chief of which will be user pages for interaction among members and for the recording of previous successful additions to Wall.

Inspired by Banksy. "Tonight the streets are ours."

# MVP 1 :
Target for Completion: Tuesday, November 2, 2015

1) Mainpage with auth (that must take valid address), and chrome-extension download button

2) User profile pages with personal info, button for redirect to the canvas composition page, and display of miniatures of past canvases

3) Composition page that allows user to draw on simulation of Google homepage, and allows them to 'Publish', which, for now, means storing it in the database with user data pointing to it

4) Deployed on Digital Ocean (continous deployment)
